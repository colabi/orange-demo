MUST HAVES
We would like you to build a version of Tic-tac-toe using Unity. Your application should target at least one AR or VR platform and support two player games as well as one player against a computer controlled player. 

Two player mode is expected to be a non-networked local experience where two players trade off with the same device.

You can use the Unity Asset Store (or any other open source assets)  for 3D models, textures, or environments, but please refrain from using any pre-existing code besides the SDK’s required for your chosen AR or VR platform. 

Please deliver a link to a compiled playable version of the application, as well as a link to the full project assets such as a GitHub/Bitbucket link.

The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe can be found here:

Optional additional challenges:
Generalize the game of Tic-tac-toe to an m,n,k-game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game 
Build an intelligent computer controlled player using your choice of AI or machine learning algorithms
Support networked online play between players
